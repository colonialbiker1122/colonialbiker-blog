title = 'Bridging IT-OT Divide'
+++
- Cultural differences
- Cross training
- Continuous Audit
- Unified convergent IT-OT team is required
- Settle periodic conflicts, budgeting, technical advisory etc
- IT-OT integration has led to increased attack surface
- Technological disparity: Legacy technology in OT domain
- Top-Down rationalisation is requireed from Board/ CXO to downwards
- Organizations don’t have OT security policies
- Don’t divide IT/OT. Treat security as a whole (Informational + Operational)
- Risk assessment + management is needed at granular level
- Skillsets and knowledge gap: White collar blue-brown collar jobs
- Upskilling from OT roles to OT-security roles is comparatively easy
- Mechanism to test patches is required
- How to deal with legacy OT systems?
- OT needs quality validations (CSV, GXP)
- How to quantify risk in OT environments?
- Deal with future threats?
- Have visibility, deal with social engineering, find vulnerabilities, supply chain issues (crowdstrikes, etc), regulatory changes
- Microsegmentation reduces impact (DCS/ SIS)
