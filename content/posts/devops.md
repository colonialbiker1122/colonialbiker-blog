## Thinking DevOps/ Social Coding Principles
- Working in small batches
- Git repository
- Minimum Viable Product
- Test-driven Development: Building the thing right
  - Test cases drive the design
  - Red, green, refactor
  - Automate testing
- Behaviour-driven development: Building the right thing
  - Gherkin
    - Given (some context)
    - When (some event happens)
    - Then (some testable outcome)
    - And (more context, events, outcomes)
  - Add acceptance criteria to every user story
- Cloud native microservices
  - Collection of stateless microservices
  - Each service maintains own database
- Designing for failure:
  - Retry pattern
  - Circuit breaker pattern
  - Bulkhead pattern
  - Chaos engineering: Monkey testing
    - Netflix: Simian Army tools
- Pair programming
- Ephemeral infrastructure as code
- Automated self-service
- Feedback loops and data driven responses

## Working DevOps
- Infrastructure as code
  - Configuration Management Systems: Executable textual format
  - Ancibel, Puppt, Chef
  - Version control
- Ephemeral immutable infrastructure
  - Transient, parallel infrastructure
- Immutable delivery via containers

### Continuous integration
- Short lived feature branches
- Each checkin is verified by automated build
- Committing regularly
- Build and test every pull request
- Run tests after each build

### Continuous delivery 
- Build quality with rigorous checks
- Work in small batches
- Automate repetitive takes to computers
- Measure for actionable metrics, pursue improvement
- Everyone is responsible

### Continuous deployment
- Production + Automation
- Feature flags: Decouple deployment from activation

### Social metrics
- Who is leveraging the code you are building?
- Whoâ€™s code are you leveraging ?

## Measuring DevOps
- Reduce time to market
- Increase overall availability
- Reduce time to deploy
- Defects detected before production
- More efficient use of hardware infrastructure
- Quicker performance feedback

1. Mean lead time
2. Release frequency
3. Change failure rate
4. Mean time to recovery
