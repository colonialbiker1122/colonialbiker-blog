## SCADA - Supervisory Control and Data Aquisition
- Gather data, process data, apply operational controls over long distances

## PLC Programmable logic Controller
- Solid state devices that hold and run programmed logic instructions for a control process
- Physically wired to sensors, actuators etc
- Sensors : Temperature, vibration, fluid level, pressure, humidity etc.
- Actuators: Solenoid, burner, compressor, pump valve, breakers, etc.

## Data Historian
- DB system for control system process information, trending data about the process and other critical information

## Engineering workstation
- Laptop/ desktop used with engineering software to view, manage, program network devices, PLCs, RTUs etc.

## Human Machine Interface (HMI)
- Graphical interface to interact with, change and control the physical process at local or remote facility
- Operators use HMI to view and acknowledge system alarms, safety conditions and monitor

## Control system network levels as Purdue Reference Architecture
	Level 0 : Sensors, Actuators
	Level 1 : Process control, Field devices
	Level 2 : HMI, Engineering workstation
	Level 3 : ICS plant site SCADA controls
	Level 4 : Enterprise IT systems
	Level 5 : Internet, Cloud services
