## 1. Vulnerability Scanning
- Unpredictable and undesirable in ICS networks
- Best performed by testing in development environment
- Review passive network captures, asset inventories, configuration files, firmware versions against threat intel and vulnerability advisories

## 2. Encryption

## 3. Patching in Industrial Environments
- More availability of patches, patch testing by ICS vendors, Availability of standards

## 4. Endpoint security for Control System Assets
- Application Whitelisting
- Endpoint Protection

## 5. Firewalls and Network Segmentation
- For containment, as checkpoints for network security monitoring (NSM) data collection
- Segmenting network zones
- Control traffic via ACLs i.e Access Control Lists
- ICS firewalls must block all direct communications to/from the Internet

## 6. Remote access for Maintenance & Support
- Implement securely in multiple layers like MFA, strict access control etc.

ICS Automation, Process Control, Access Control devices, System Accounts, Assets are very valuable to attackers.
