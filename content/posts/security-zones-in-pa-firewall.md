title = 'Security Zones in Palo Alto Networks Firewall'
+++
## Zone
- Designates a network segment in which all nodes share similar network security requirements
- Zone is a logical way to group physical and virtual interfaces
- Zones control and lock traffic that traverse through the interfaces
- All defined interfaces must be assigned a zone that marks all the traffic coming to or from the interface
- Zones are defined for specific interface types â€“ tap, virtual wire, layer 2, layer 3 etc.
- An interface can be assigned only to a single zone.
- All sessions on the firewall are defined by source and destination zones
- Rules can use defined zones to allow or deny traffic, apply quality of service(QoS) policies, perform NAT etc.
- By default, all traffic can freely flow within zones in the case of intrazone traffic
- By default, traffic between zones is denied in case of interzone traffic
- All policies reference a source and destination zone to match traffic
- Policies are assessed in top down manner
- Security policy rules are used to create positive or negative enforcement model for traffic
- If logging enabled for matching policy, the action for that session is logged
- Multiple match conditions can be used to create a policy such as security zones, source IP, destination IP, devices, applications (App ID), source user (user ID), service (port), URL etc
## SP3: Single Pass Parallel Processing Architecture
- Enables packet evaluation, application identification, policy decision and content scanning in a single efficient processing pass.
