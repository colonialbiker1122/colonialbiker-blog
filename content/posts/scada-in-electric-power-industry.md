## SCADA system capabilities
- Access quantitative measurements of important processes both immediately and over time
- Detect and correct problems as soon as they happen
- Measure trends over tine
- Discover and eliminate bottlenecks and inefficiencies
- Control larger and more complex processes
- Information can be meter readings, current quality, power outages etc.

## Stages
- Data acquisition
  - Sensors (digital/ analog)
  - Control relays
- Data collectors
  - Remote Terminal Unit (RTU): Small computerised units deployed in fields at specific sites. RTUs serve as local collection points for gathering reports from sensors and delivering commands to control relays
- Data communication
  - Network which connects SCADA master unit to RTU
- Data Presentation and Control
  - SCADA master units: Large computer consoles that serve as the central processor for SCADA system. Master units provide a human interface to the system and automatically regulate the manages system in response to sensor inputs

## RTU Connections
- RJ45 serial ports (terminal server)
- RJ45 10/100 Ethernet ports
- RJ11 Telco jack
- 50 pin connectors for discretes and relays
- 4 pin screw plugs for analogs

## Electric SCADA measurements
- Voltage , current, reactance
- Status of line devices: Switches, Breakers, Reclosers, cap banks, voltage regulators etc
- Status of customer serving devices: Transformers, street lights
- Electric usage data (metering)
- Outage data from all devices
- 50 Hz waveform
- Substation switch house equipment

## Risks
- Physical threats
- Insider threats
- Antiquated systems
- Incompetence
- Malwares
- Denial of service

## Impacts
- Property damage
- Asset damage
- Blackouts
- Meter data security
- Loss of billing data
