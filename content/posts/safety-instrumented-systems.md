## Safety on the whole combines
- Physical Infrastructure and Safeguards
- Process control logic (soft interlocks)
- Physical safeguards (burst disks, mechanical trips, 1-way valve)
- Safety Instrumented systems

## Failure modes for ICS
- Intermittent failures:
  - Corrected by logic conditions in the system
  - Minimal to no process interruption
- Nuisance trips:
  - Logic interlocks, fail safes
- Unplanned outages:
  - Sustained process failures
- Dangerous failures:
  - Kinetic and safety impacts
  - Extended outages
