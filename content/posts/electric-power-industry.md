## Introduction
### Few typical components
- Generating station
- Generator step up transformer
- Transmission lines
- Substration step down transformer
- Customer (subtransmission/ primary/ secondary)

### Types of Power Sources
Renewable: wind, solar, hydro
Non-renewable: coal, natural gas

### Why is Electricity difficult to manage?
- Electricity cannot be routed/ controlled
- Power flows via the path of least resistance

### Elements of substation
- Primary power line
- Ground wire
- Transformer for measuring electric voltage
- Disconnect switch
- Circuit breaker
- Current transformer
- Lightning arrester
- Main transformer
- Control building
- Security fence
- Secondary power line

### Distribution line devices
- Voltage regulator
- Capacitor bank
- Gang operated switch
- Reclosers: automatic
- Fused disconnect
- Distribution transformer

## Smart Grid
An example of a use case of smart grid is where E-vehicles which are battery powered also are compatible to 2 way power distribution i.e Power from a vehicle can be used to power a site in case of main grid failure and at other times, be used as it was intended to.

## Smart grid components
- Utility communications
- Consumer portal and building EMS
- Advanced metering
- Distributed generation and storage
- Plug-in hybrids
- Smart end-use devices
- Distributed operations
- Dynamic system control
- Renewables : solar/ PV, wind, etc
- Data management
- Distribution automation / transmission automation
